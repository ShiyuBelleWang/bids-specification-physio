    MeasureType:
      level: recommended
      level_addendum: required if `PhysioType` is `specified`
      description_addendum: |
        MUST be: "Trigger", "PPG", "ECG", "Ventilation", "CO2", "O2", 
        “PetCO2”, “PetO2”, "EDA-tonic", “EDA-phasic”, “EDA-total”, 
        “EMG”, “BP”, “Other”
    Units:
      level: recommended
      level_addendum: required if `PhysioType` is `specified`
      description_addendum: |
        If the measure has units that can be described, or “au” if 
        missing and PhysioType is “specified”.
    Placement:
      level: recommended
      description_addendum: |
        Placement of sensor. Non-physiological and trigger columns must have “n/a”.
    Description:
      level: recommended
      description_addendum: |
        Freeform natural language description.
    AmplifierSettings:
      level: recommended
      description_addendum: |
        Amplifier settings during data acquisition (e.g. gain, sampling filters, bandwidth, etc.)
        Strings MAY be represented in the format Setting:Value  (e.g. Gain:10)
    ChannelManufacturersModelName:
      level: recommended
      description_addendum: |
        Manufacturer's model name(s) of each piece of hardware equipment that 
        produced the measurements upstream of the recording device, including 
        the sensor, connecting cables, and amplifiers. Equipment should be 
        listed in order of attachment, from participant to recording device.
    ChannelManufacturer:
      level: recommended
      description_addendum: |
        Manufacturer(s) of each piece of the equipment that produced the 
        measurements upstream of the recording device, including the sensor, 
        connecting cables, and amplifiers. If more than one manufacturer 
        applies, list the manufacturer for each piece of hardware, in order 
        of attachment from participant to recording device.
    ChannelDeviceSerialNumber:
      level: recommended
      description_addendum: |
        The serial number(s) of each piece of hardware equipment that produced
        the measurements, including the sensor, connecting cables, and amplifiers.
        Equipment should be listed in order of attachment, from participant to
        recording device. A pseudonym can also be used to prevent the equipment
        from being identifiable, so long as each pseudonym is unique within the dataset.
